# Anomaly Detection and Predictive Analysis for API Response Times

## 1.Description
This project implements anomaly detection using Isolation Forest and Autoencoder, combined with LSTM-based time series forecasting to analyze API response times. The model enables real-time anomaly detection, proactive failure prediction, and performance optimization. Built with Python, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow, it ensures scalable and data-driven log analysis.

## 2. Features

### Anomaly Detection:
#### Isolation Forest:
- Uses a tree-based approach to isolate anomalies based on feature splits.
- Efficient for high-dimensional data with low computational cost.
- Detects anomalies based on their uniqueness in the dataset.
#### Autoencoder:
- Neural network-based anomaly detection using unsupervised learning.
- Learns compressed representations of normal data patterns.
- Identifies anomalies through high reconstruction error when input deviates from learned patterns.
### Predictive Analysis:

#### LSTM Model for Response Time Forecasting

- Utilizes a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network**, a specialized **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**, to model sequential dependencies in API response times.  
- Learns from **historical response time logs** to predict future latency trends with high accuracy.  
- Captures **seasonality, sudden spikes, and anomalies** in response behavior for better trend analysis.  
- Enables **proactive performance optimization**, aiding in **server scaling, request load balancing, and anomaly prevention**.  
- Supports **real-time decision-making** by identifying potential slowdowns before they impact system performance.

#### Real-time Monitoring

- Implements **continuous log analysis** to detect anomalies and predict trends dynamically.  
- Can be integrated with **real-time dashboards** for live system health monitoring.  
- Enables **quick response to system failures**, minimizing downtime and ensuring system reliability.  

####Optimized Detection:

- Combines statistical (Isolation Forest), deep learning (Autoencoder), and sequential (LSTM) methods for robust anomaly detection.
- Hybrid approach improves accuracy by reducing false positives and capturing complex anomalies.
- Allows adaptive thresholding and dynamic anomaly detection based on evolving system behavior.
