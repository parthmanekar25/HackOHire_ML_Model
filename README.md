# Anomaly Detection and Predictive Analysis for API Response Times
## 1.Description
This project implements anomaly detection using Isolation Forest and Autoencoder, combined with LSTM-based time series forecasting to analyze API response times. The model enables real-time anomaly detection, proactive failure prediction, and performance optimization. Built with Python, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow, it ensures scalable and data-driven log analysis.
